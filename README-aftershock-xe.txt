AfterShock XE (AfterShock Extended Edition) is a (hopefully temporary) 
fork of the AfterShock mod for OpenArena FPS game.
AfterShock is a mod that brings more competitive features and
customization to OpenArena.
The need for this fork arised because the development of AfterShock
stopped and the AfterShock developers are currently out of reach, 
but we needed to add a few features.

AfterShock XE codebase is available @ https://github.com/Irbyz/aftershock-xe

You can currently get in touch with us on vihmu OpenArena team Discord 
server that you can access with this invite link:
