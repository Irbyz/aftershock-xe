		- added cg_soundOption <0-9> to alter between sound packs, 
  default value is 1
	Valid values for cg_soundOption are 0-9. A value of 0 sets all
  sounds to default. A value of X (with X = 1-9) loads option X
  for all sounds. A sound S.wav with option X has to have the name
  S_optX.wav in the pk3.
	If S_optX.wav does not exist it falls back to S.wav
	
	   - added cg_soundOption* <-1-9> to alter between individual sounds

    * cg_soundOptionRocket
    * cg_soundOptionGrenade
    * cg_soundOptionPlasma
    * cg_soundOptionRail
    * cg_soundOptionBFG
    cg_soundOption* can overwrite the sounds set by cg_soundOption
    If the option does not exist it falls back to cg_soundOption
  (which falls back to the default sound)
