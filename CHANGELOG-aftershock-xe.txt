2018-07-16 AfterShock XE Revision 312

		- fixed vote passed/vote failed bug completely
		
		- fixed a bug when flood limit would have false positives
		
		- added  cg_fastforward and cg_fastforwardSpeed
	cg_fastforward gives the seconds a demo should be forwarded
	cg_fastforwardSpeed gives the speed of the forwarding (like timescale)
	So if you set cg_fastforwardSpeed = 100 and cg_fastforward = 600
  the demo will forward 10 minutes (600 seconds) with 100x speed
  
		- fixed powerup disappearing bug
  (that happens on ps37ctf-mmp map)
  
        - fixed a bug when maplist wouldn't be displayed if it got over 
  1024 characters

2018-07-07 AfterShock XE Revision 311

		- added cg_soundOption <0-9> to alter between sound packs, 
  default value is 1
	Valid values for cg_soundOption are 0-9. A value of 0 sets all
  sounds to default. A value of X (with X = 1-9) loads option X
  for all sounds. A sound S.wav with option X has to have the name
  S_optX.wav in the pk3.
	If S_optX.wav does not exist it falls back to S.wav
	
	   - added cg_soundOption* <-1-9> to alter between individual sounds
  for weapons:
	* cg_soundOptionGauntlet
    * cg_soundOptionLightning
    * cg_soundOptionMachinegun
    * cg_soundOptionShotgun
    * cg_soundOptionRocket
    * cg_soundOptionGrenade
    * cg_soundOptionPlasma
    * cg_soundOptionRail
    * cg_soundOptionBFG
    cg_soundOption* can overwrite the sounds set by cg_soundOption
    If the option does not exist it falls back to cg_soundOption
  (which falls back to the default sound)
