        - improved spawn behavior in team modes
        
        - added g_spawnPush cvar for improved spawn behavior
	If g_spawnPush is set to 1, a player that spawns inside of a team
  member will get pushed forward and spawn infront of him
	If g_spawnPush is set to 0, a player that spawns inside of a team
  member will get stuck (default OA behavior)
        
        - added g_telefragTeamBehavior cvar for improved telefrag 
  behavior
	g_telefragTeamBehavior = 0: If a player teleports into a team
  member, they both will get stuck (default OA behavior)
	g_telefragTeamBehavior = 1: If a player teleports into a team
  member, the player wil be pushed forward and spawn in front of him
	g_telefragTeamBehavior = 2: If a player would teleport into a team
  member, the teleporter will not work and the player will stay at the
  teleporter entry until the team member moved
  
        - added support for projectile teleportation sound (in/out)  
	The new sound files can be put in:

2018-07-27 AfterShock XE Revision 318

        - fixed a bug when the projectiles would get stopped mid air in 
  some places on some maps

2018-07-27 AfterShock XE Revision 317

        - added support for shooting projectiles through teleporters 
  with two new cvars:
  
	1. g_allowProjectileTeleport: this is a bitmask
  Bit 0 = rocket, bit 1 = pasma, bit 2 = grenade
  Examples: 7 => allow all three (default)
            1 => allow only rocket
            3 => allow rocket and grenade
	2. g_projectileTeleportKeepAngle: This controls the angle of the
  projectile
  If this is set to 1 (default), the projectile will go out of the 
  teleporter at the same angle it entered
  If this is set to 0, the projectile will always exit the teleporter
  straight. This is the behavior that players entering a teleporter
  have

	cg_fastforward gives the seconds a demo should be forwarded
	cg_fastforwardSpeed gives the speed of the forwarding (like timescale)

  the demo will forward 10 minutes (600 seconds) with 100x speed

2018-07-07 AfterShock XE Revision 311

		- added cg_soundOption <0-9> to alter between sound packs, 
  default value is 1
	Valid values for cg_soundOption are 0-9. A value of 0 sets all
  sounds to default. A value of X (with X = 1-9) loads option X
  for all sounds. A sound S.wav with option X has to have the name
  S_optX.wav in the pk3.
	If S_optX.wav does not exist it falls back to S.wav
	
	   - added cg_soundOption* <-1-9> to alter between individual sounds
  for weapons:
	* cg_soundOptionGauntlet
    * cg_soundOptionLightning
    * cg_soundOptionMachinegun
    * cg_soundOptionShotgun
    * cg_soundOptionRocket
    * cg_soundOptionGrenade
    * cg_soundOptionPlasma
    * cg_soundOptionRail
    * cg_soundOptionBFG
    cg_soundOption* can overwrite the sounds set by cg_soundOption
    If the option does not exist it falls back to cg_soundOption
  (which falls back to the default sound)
